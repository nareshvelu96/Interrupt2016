Do you have the skills to lay out an attractive trap, luring customers to choose your company?\n\nDo you have the gift of the gab?\n\nIf you think you do, we would say come and show us at MYB event at Interrupt!\n        </item>

        <item>On Site Event</item>

        <item>What is data? Is it letters? Is it numbers?\nIs it a combination of both? Or is it something completely abstract?\nWell, everything counts as data. Right from alphabets to the copies of oxford dictionary, from the number of times your cat sneezed to the various cat videos\non YouTube everything is data.\nSo how do we store data?\nCan you visualize structures to store data?\nDoes your brain automatically link nodes in the form of lists\nor does it make it more complex by branching? If you can\ndo that, then can you translate those diagrams into segments of code? \n\nCome and try your hand at the data structures event.        </item>

        <item>Round 1\nYou have 20 minutes to answer 20 questions. Qualifiers will move on to the next round.\n\nRound 2\nThis is a surprise round but prepare yourself for some hardcore coding.

        <item>On Site Event</item>
        <item>
Imagine you’re watching an episode of Sherlock. What happens in every case?\nEvidences and red herrings pop up and we try to solve the case along with Sherlock and Watson.\nIn the end you’d have noticed what cracks the case would be the seemingly harmless scribble\non the book which lies open carelessly during the time of murder.\nEvery piece of information out there provides clues to the most complex problems.\nRecorded details of the past prove to be the ultimate evidence in the present.\n
So do you have what it takes to store valuable information?\n Tables are a tool and an archive is a library of data.\nDo you have what it takes to become a DBA?\n
Here’s an opportunity you wouldn’t want to miss!\nPut your database skills to the best use and show who’s the boss.\nCreate tables that could change the way we perceive and extract information.\nNormalize your data to achieve supreme efficiency.\nThe game is going to be an intense one.\nAre you ready to battle it out in a game of archives?Come, show it at Interrupt!\n
</item>
        <item>1. Query Round:\n
This is the qualifying round that takes place on site.\nJust with some queries and you could be part of the epic battle.\n\n

2. Scenario Round:\n

Here’s where the real challenge lies.\nCreate the apt database for the scenario we give and add your personal streak to it.\nAchieve perfection by normalizing it.\n\nRULES:\n

1. Basic knowledge of MySQL queries is expected (select, insert, create, etc.).\nTo be the best of the pack some additional concepts would do you good.\n\n
2. This is a team event. \nA team of 2 is required to take part in this event.\n\n
3. Round 2 will be solely judged on how relevant the content of your tables are with the given scenario.\n\n
Sample Question:\n
Prepare a bill showing item details and the price such that he eats the\nmaximum number of items and yet he pays only between Rs.1000 and Rs.1500.\n\n</item>

<string name="about_interrupt">Webster\’s Dictionary defines the word ‘Interrupt’ as ”to break off or cause to cease, as in the middle of something”.\nComputer scientists define ‘Interrupt’ as ”A hardware signal that breaks the flow of program execution and transfers control to a predetermined storage location so that another procedure can be followed or a new operation carried out”, but at SVCE, we define Interrupt simply as THE place to be for anyone with a passion for CS.\n\nInterrupt has had students marking their calendars for years now and this year it\’s back and bigger than ever!\nAre you the Don of Logic? Can you make databases dance to your tunes?\nOr is being a Code Ninja more your style? Join us at SVCE on October 1st and find out!\n\n
Keep up with all the Interrupt news!\n

<string name="interrupt16">‘Boisterous’-One word that describes Interrupt’14 best. As always, the symposium

had surpassed the expectations and set the bar really high making it even more

challenging for the subsequent years to come. There were multiple online and offline

events covering both the technical and non-technical side. The workshop on web

development helped the students explore this wide arena. Numbers say a lot more

than words. So, seeing how there were about 1500 students who participated from

across the country, this event was a huge success.</string>

        <item>Do you have what it takes to survive against a wild bear if you just have just a blanket,\n a broomstick and an ice-cream sandwich on you?\nCan you de-code cryptic messages and come up with an algorithm to save the day?\nAre you better than others at lateral thinking?\nIf your answer to the above questions are yes, then only one thing remains to be decided.\nAre you worthy of being the Don Of Logic?\n\n</item>

        <item>Round 1: Written Test\nA set of 30 lateral thinking questions, to be answered in 45 minutes. 10 people will be moved into the next round.\nThere will be one bonus question in the case of ties.\n\n
Round 2: Quiz\nThe 10 people are cast into teams of 2 according to their marks in the previous round,\nso that there are 5 teams totally.\nEach team is given 5 cards initially. The card will have a daily household object like a blanket or a broomstick. \nThere is one special card, which has all the objects (tools). This is called a Wild Card.\nThe quiz master poses a survival question, and each team has to take out an answer card and place it face down.\nOnce all the teams have done so, each team has to show what tool they used and why they used that tool.\nOnly if the explanation is correct, will the team be awarded a point.\nEach team will now be given a new card (can be any tool) from the pack.\nThe three teams which get 13 points first move into the next round.\nSuppose someone uses the correct tool but doesn\'t give the correct explanation, they will not be awarded a point.\n Suppose someone knows the answer but doesn\'t have\nthe correct card, they will not be awarded a point.\nSuppose someone uses a Wild Card but doesn\'t tell what tool they\'re using\nfrom the EC correctly, they won\'t get a point.\n(Maximum time: 90-100 minutes)\n\n

Round 3: Coding with a twist\nEach finalist will get a question to write a simple program in C or C++ (their choice)\n.The twist is that the question will be in a code.\nSo first the finalist has to decode the question, and once they do that,\nthey need to write, compile and execute the question.\nTotal time for this round is 45 minutes.\n\n</item>
